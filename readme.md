# About this script
Some controls in Genshin Impact could be annoying or frustrating. So I tried to fix it with this script.  

### How to use it
1. Download [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) (current version)
1. Download this repository
1. Run the .ahk script with administrator rights

### Features
- Hold F to pick up loot
- Auto attack mode (disables automatically in a menu)
    - hold LMB to perform normal attacks
    - click or hold RMB to perform charged attack
- Receive all rewards from expeditions (Numpad1)
- Send characters on expeditions (Numpad2)
- Fast change of the current party (Numpad4 - previous, Numpad6 - next)
- Autorun (XButton1) 
- Spam LMB click (XButton2) 
- Pauses when the game window is not active (or explicitly on Pause key)

### Additional info
- Most of the features are hard coded for 1920x1080 game resolution
- The script has no GUI
- LMB spam can be useful for increasing/decreasing ore amount when upgrading a weapon
- Fast change of the party is useful during exploration. For example, I have 2 parties: main one, and the second one for trials. With this feature I can change to my trial party quickly, complete the trial and change back to the main party
