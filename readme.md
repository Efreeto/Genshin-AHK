### About this script
Some controls in Genshin Impact could be annoying or frustrating. So I tried to fix it with this script.

The script is hard coded for 1920x1080 game resolution.

### How to use it
1. Download [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) (the script is tested on version 1.1.33.08)
2. Download this repository (including all `.ahk` files)
3. Run `better-genshin-controls.ahk` (requires administrator rights)
4. Run the game in fullscreen mode or in [borderless window mode](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/376533)

### Features
- Hold F to pick up loot
- Auto attack mode (disables automatically in a menu)
    - hold LMB to perform normal attacks
    - click or hold RMB to perform charged attack
- Receive all rewards from expeditions (Numpad1)
- Send characters on expeditions (Numpad2)
- Receive battle pass experience and rewards (Numpad .)
- Go to the serenitea pot (Numpad5)
- Relogin (Numpad3)
- Wait for the next night (Numpad7)
- Change current party (Numpad4 - previous, Numpad6 - next)
- Teleport in one click (move your cursor to desirable location on the world map and click Middle mouse button)
- Spam LMB click (XButton2) 
- Lock artifact (Numpad8, works only in the bag menu)
- Craft maximum amount of ores (Numpad9, works in the blacksmith menu)
- You can hold 1-4 to switch characters instead of clicking  
- Pauses when the game window is not active (or explicitly on Pause key)
- Closes when the game is closed

### Not so fair features
- Auto unfreeze/unbubble
- Animation cancelling for Klee (XButton1)

### Additional info
- The script has no GUI
- Relogin is useful to respawn bosses
- LMB spam is useful to skip dialogs or to increase/decrease item count while upgrading a weapon or a character
