# About this script
Some controls in Genshin Impact could be annoying or frustrating. So I tried to fix it with this script.

The script is hard coded for 1920x1080 game resolution.

### How to use it
1. Download [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) (the script is tested on version 1.1.33.08)
2. Download this repository
3. Run the .ahk script with administrator rights
4. Run the game in fullscreen mode or in borderless window mode (with "-popupwindow" option)

### Features
- Hold F to pick up loot
- Auto attack mode (disables automatically in a menu)
    - hold LMB to perform normal attacks
    - click or hold RMB to perform charged attack
- Receive all rewards from expeditions (Numpad1)
- Send characters on expeditions (Numpad2)
- Fast change of the current party (Numpad4 - previous, Numpad6 - next)
- Go to the serenitea pot (Numpad5)
- Animation cancelling for Klee (XButton1)
- Spam LMB click (XButton2) 
- You can hold 1-4 to switch to a character  
- Pauses when the game window is not active (or explicitly on Pause key)

### Additional info
- The script has no GUI
- LMB spam can be useful for increasing/decreasing ore amount when upgrading a weapon
- Fast change of the party is useful during exploration. For example, I have 2 parties: main one, and the second one for trials. With this feature I can change to my trial party quickly, complete the trial and change back to the main party
