# About this script
Some of the controls in genshin impact can be annoying or frustrating. So I tried to fix it with this script.

### How to use it
1. Download [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) (current version)
1. Download this repository
1. Run the .ahk script with administrator rights

### Features
- Hold F to pick up loot
- Auto attack mode (disables automatically in a menu)
    - hold LMB to perform basic attacks
    - click RMB to perform strong attack
- Receive all rewards from expeditions (Numpad2)
- Send characters on expeditions (Numpad3)
- Fast change of the current party (Numpad4 - previous, Numpad6 - next)
- Hold Numpad '-' key to spam LMB click
- Klee machine gun: hold XButton2 to perform first basic attacks and jump with perfect timing
- Pauses when the game window is not active (or explicitly on Pause key)

### Additional info
- Most of the features are hard coded for 1920x1080 game resolution. Create an issue if you want the support for your resolution
- Expeditions and characters for them are also hard coded
- LMB spam can be useful for increasing/decreasing ore amount when upgrading a weapon
- Fast change of the party is useful during exploration. For example I have 2 parties: main one and the second one for trials. With this feature I can change to my trial party quickly, complete the trial and change back to the main party
- I have made Klee machine gun feature for fun and I don't know how effective this technique is in terms of DPS

### TODO
- Custom resolution option
- Expeditions customization
- Your suggestions?
